# GoBot
This is the source code of a telegram bot to manage a carpooling service for students in NTU. 



HOW TO USE: 

The chat for which this token API is designed for is @gaymax_bot on Telegram, findable through global search. It accepts multiple commands, but only the following are being considered:

/init

/submit

/show

/showme

The rest of the commands are designed for other functionalities. For example, the /sethome command is used to add a location to a user's nickname in a group chat.
