# GoBot
This is the source code of a telegram bot to manage a carpooling service for students in NTU. 


NOTE: THIS IS DEPRECATED CODE. IT IS NO LONGER IN USE. NEWER VERSIONS OF GOBOT HAVE UPDATED FUNCTIONALITIES. THIS IS ONLY A DEMONSTRATION AND TEMPLATE.

This project will probably be further expanded during the summer holidays.

Future functionalities include: Matching and alerting users based on open carpooling events.

Pull requests are encouraged.


HOW TO USE: 

The chat for which this token API is designed for is @gaymax_bot on Telegram, findable through global search. It accepts multiple commands, but only the following are being considered:

/init

/submit

/show

/showme

The rest of the commands are designed for other functionalities. For example, the /sethome command is used to add a location to a user's nickname in a group chat.
