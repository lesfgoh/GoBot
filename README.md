# GoBot
This is the source code of a telegram bot to manage a carpooling service for students in NTU. 


NOTE: THIS IS DEPRECATED CODE. IT IS NO LONGER IN USE. NEWER VERSIONS OF GOBOT HAVE UPDATED FUNCTIONALITIES. THIS IS ONLY A DEMONSTRATION AND TEMPLATE.

This project will probably be further expanded during the summer holidays.

Future functionalities include: Matching and alerting users based on open carpooling events.

Pull requests are encouraged.
